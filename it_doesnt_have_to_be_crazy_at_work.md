== First 


== Curb Your Ambition


== Defend Your Time 



=== Protectionism

Companies protest/guard so many things but all too often they fail to protect whats both most vulnerable and most precious: their employee's time and attention.

At Basecamp, we see it as our top responsibility to protect our employees' time and attemption. 

At Basecamp they ask people to write updates daily or weekly for others to read when they have a free moment.

=== The Quality of an Hour

A quality hours is 1 x 60  
A quality day is at least 4 x 60

Look at your hours. 
If they're a bunch of fractions who or what is doing the division. 
What can you change?

=== Effective > Productive

When people focus os productivity they end up focusing on being busy. 
Basecamp believes in effectiveness. 
How little can we do? 
How much can be cut out?

Being productive is about occupying your time - filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can.

Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work.

If you're only get 3 hours of work to do on a given day then stop. 
Don't fill your day with 5 more just to stay busy or feel productive.

=== The Outwork Myth

Assuming you can work harder and longer than someone else is giving yourself too much credit for your effort and not enough of theirs.

A great work ethic isnt about working whenver you're called upon. 
It's about doing what you say you're going to do, puttingin a fair days work, respecting the work, respecting the customer, respeting coworkers, not wasting time, not creating unnecessary work for other people and not being a bottleneck.

Work ethic is about being a fundamentally good person that others can count on and enjoy working with.

Stop equating work ethic with excessive work hours.

=== Work Doesnt Happen At Work

The major distractions at work are from the inside.

People get more work done in interruption free zones.

People are working longer and later because they can't get work done at work anymore.

=== Office Hours

All subject matter experts at Basecamp publish office hours. 
Its up to each expert to decide their availability.

This might seem inefficient at first glance. 
It turns out waiting is no big deal most of the time.

=== Calendar Tetris

The shared work calendar is destructive.

No one can see anyone else's calendar at Basecamp.

When you optimize people's calendar for effortless carving you shouldnt be surprised when people's time is sliced up.

Taking people's time should be a pain in the ass. 
Meetings should be the last resort, especially big ones.

Nobody ever declines an invittion in good conscience. 
No one wants to be seen as "difficult" or "inaccessible".

=== The Presence Prison

As a general rule, nobody at Basecamp really knows when anyone else is at any given moment.

They dont require anyone to broadcast their whereabouts or availability.

What if you need something from someone and you dont know if they are available? just ask.

Assume people are focused on their own work.

Everyone's status should be implicit. 
I'm trying to do my job, please respect my time and attention.

=== I'll Get Back to You Whenver

The expectation of an immediate response has become the new normal.

How fast you can reach someone has nothing to do with how quickly they need to get back to you. 
The content dictates that.

Culture of eventual response. 
One where we not only accept but strongly encourage people not to check email or chat or IM for long strectches of uninterrupted time.

=== FOMO? JOMO!

FOMO - Fear of missing out  
JOMO - Joy of missing out

People should be missing out. 
Most people should miss out on most things most of the time.

There is absolutely no reason everyone needs to attempt to know everything thats going on in the company. 
Most of it is mundane.

Monthly "Heart beats" - Summaries of the work and progress thats been done and had by a team, written by the team lead, to the entire company. 
Essential points that others would care to know.

== Feed Your Culture

=== We're Not Family

We are coworkers not family. 
That doesn't mean we dont care about one another. 
We do care and we do help.

Motive for talking about the company as a family is more likely to be unidirectional form of sacrifice. yours

You don't have to pretend to be a famiily to be courteous or kind or protective. 
All those values can be expressed even better in principles, policies, and most important actions.

The best companies arent families. 
They're  supporters of families. 
Allies of families.

=== They'll Do As You Do

You can't credibly promote the virtues of reasonable hours, plentiful rest and a healthy lifestyle to employees if you're doing the opposite as the boss.

It doesnt matter what you say, it matters what you do.

If the only way you can inspire the troops is by a regimen of exhaustion, it's time to look for some deeper substance.

A leader who stes an example of self sacrifice cant help but ask fself sacrifice of others.

Workaholism is a contagious disease. 
You cant stop the spiral if you're the one bringing it into the office.

=== The Trust Battery

Coin by Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke

It's charged at 50% when people are first hired and then every time you work with someone at the company the trust batter between hte two of you is either charged or discharged based on things like whether you deliver on hat you promised.

Trust batter is a summary of all interactions to ate.

If you want to recharge the battery you have to do things different things in the future. 
Only new actions and new attitudes count.

Plus its personal. 
The recharging is moslty one to one.

A low trust battery is at the core of many personal disputes at work.

The worst thing you n do is pretend that interpersonal feelings dont matter. 
That work should "just be about work". 
Thats just ignorant. 
Humans are human whether they're at work or at home.

=== Dont Be the Last To Know

When the boss says "My door is always open" its a cop-out not an invitation. 
One that puts the onus of speaking up entirely on the employees.

If you really want to know whats going on you need to ask 

* What's something nobody dares to talk about?
* Are you afraid of anything at work?
* Is there anything you worked on recently that you wish you could do over?
* What do you thinkg we could have done diffrently to help Hane succeed?
* What advice would you give before we start on the big website redesign project?

Posing real, pointed questions is the only way to convey that its safe to provide real answers. 
And event then its going to take a while.

The CIO is usually the last to know

You shouldn't ask before you're willing and able to at on the answer.

=== The Owner's Word Weights a Ton

There is no such thing as a casual suggestion when to comes from the owner. 
Inevitably becomes a top priority.

It takes great restraint as the leader of an org not to keep lobbing ideas at everyone else. 
Every such idea is a pebble thats going to cause ripples when it hits the surface.

=== Low Hanging Fruit Can Still Be Out of Reach

The further away you are form the fruit the lower it looks. 
Once you get up close you see its quite a bit higher than you thought. 
We assumed that picking it will be easy because we've never tried to do it before.

Declaring that an unfamiliar task will yield low hanging fruit is almost always an admission that you have little insight about what you're setting out to do.

The worst is when you load up these expectations on new hires and assume they'll meet them all quickly. 
You're basically setting them up to fail.

The idea that you'll instantly more needles because you've never tried to move them until now is delusional.

=== Don't Cheat Sleep

Continued sleep deprivation batters your IQ and saps your creativity

=== Out of Whack

Be responsible with your tie and make sure your team knowns when you wont be arond.

We ask reasonable people to make reasonable choices and the company will be reasonable back.

=== Hire the WOrk, Not the Resume

== First 


== Curb Your Ambition


== Defend Your Time 



=== Protectionism

Companies protest/guard so many things but all too often they fail to protect whats both most vulnerable and most precious: their employee's time and attention.

At Basecamp, we see it as our top responsibility to protect our employees' time and attemption. 

At Basecamp they ask people to write updates daily or weekly for others to read when they have a free moment.

=== The Quality of an Hour

A quality hours is 1 x 60  
A quality day is at least 4 x 60

Look at your hours. 
If they're a bunch of fractions who or what is doing the division. 
What can you change?

=== Effective > Productive

When people focus os productivity they end up focusing on being busy. 
Basecamp believes in effectiveness. 
How little can we do? 
How much can be cut out?

Being productive is about occupying your time - filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can.

Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work.

If you're only get 3 hours of work to do on a given day then stop. 
Don't fill your day with 5 more just to stay busy or feel productive.

=== The Outwork Myth

Assuming you can work harder and longer than someone else is giving yourself too much credit for your effort and not enough of theirs.

A great work ethic isnt about working whenver you're called upon. 
It's about doing what you say you're going to do, puttingin a fair days work, respecting the work, respecting the customer, respeting coworkers, not wasting time, not creating unnecessary work for other people and not being a bottleneck.

Work ethic is about being a fundamentally good person that others can count on and enjoy working with.

Stop equating work ethic with excessive work hours.

=== Work Doesnt Happen At Work

The major distractions at work are from the inside.

People get more work done in interruption free zones.

People are working longer and later because they can't get work done at work anymore.

=== Office Hours

All subject matter experts at Basecamp publish office hours. 
Its up to each expert to decide their availability.

This might seem inefficient at first glance. 
It turns out waiting is no big deal most of the time.

=== Calendar Tetris

The shared work calendar is destructive.

No one can see anyone else's calendar at Basecamp.

When you optimize people's calendar for effortless carving you shouldnt be surprised when people's time is sliced up.

Taking people's time should be a pain in the ass. 
Meetings should be the last resort, especially big ones.

Nobody ever declines an invittion in good conscience. 
No one wants to be seen as "difficult" or "inaccessible".

=== The Presence Prison

As a general rule, nobody at Basecamp really knows when anyone else is at any given moment.

They dont require anyone to broadcast their whereabouts or availability.

What if you need something from someone and you dont know if they are available? just ask.

Assume people are focused on their own work.

Everyone's status should be implicit. 
I'm trying to do my job, please respect my time and attention.

=== I'll Get Back to You Whenver

The expectation of an immediate response has become the new normal.

How fast you can reach someone has nothing to do with how quickly they need to get back to you. 
The content dictates that.

Culture of eventual response. 
One where we not only accept but strongly encourage people not to check email or chat or IM for long strectches of uninterrupted time.

=== FOMO? JOMO!

FOMO - Fear of missing out  
JOMO - Joy of missing out

People should be missing out. 
Most people should miss out on most things most of the time.

There is absolutely no reason everyone needs to attempt to know everything thats going on in the company. 
Most of it is mundane.

Monthly "Heart beats" - Summaries of the work and progress thats been done and had by a team, written by the team lead, to the entire company. 
Essential points that others would care to know.

== Feed Your Culture

=== We're Not Family

We are coworkers not family. 
That doesn't mean we dont care about one another. 
We do care and we do help.

Motive for talking about the company as a family is more likely to be unidirectional form of sacrifice. yours

You don't have to pretend to be a famiily to be courteous or kind or protective. 
All those values can be expressed even better in principles, policies, and most important actions.

The best companies arent families. 
They're  supporters of families. 
Allies of families.

=== They'll Do As You Do

You can't credibly promote the virtues of reasonable hours, plentiful rest and a healthy lifestyle to employees if you're doing the opposite as the boss.

It doesnt matter what you say, it matters what you do.

If the only way you can inspire the troops is by a regimen of exhaustion, it's time to look for some deeper substance.

A leader who stes an example of self sacrifice cant help but ask fself sacrifice of others.

Workaholism is a contagious disease. 
You cant stop the spiral if you're the one bringing it into the office.

=== The Trust Battery

Coin by Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke

It's charged at 50% when people are first hired and then every time you work with someone at the company the trust batter between hte two of you is either charged or discharged based on things like whether you deliver on hat you promised.

Trust batter is a summary of all interactions to ate.

If you want to recharge the battery you have to do things different things in the future. 
Only new actions and new attitudes count.

Plus its personal. 
The recharging is moslty one to one.

A low trust battery is at the core of many personal disputes at work.

The worst thing you n do is pretend that interpersonal feelings dont matter. 
That work should "just be about work". 
Thats just ignorant. 
Humans are human whether they're at work or at home.

=== Dont Be the Last To Know

When the boss says "My door is always open" its a cop-out not an invitation. 
One that puts the onus of speaking up entirely on the employees.

If you really want to know whats going on you need to ask 

* What's something nobody dares to talk about?
* Are you afraid of anything at work?
* Is there anything you worked on recently that you wish you could do over?
* What do you thinkg we could have done diffrently to help Hane succeed?
* What advice would you give before we start on the big website redesign project?

Posing real, pointed questions is the only way to convey that its safe to provide real answers. 
And event then its going to take a while.

The CIO is usually the last to know

You shouldn't ask before you're willing and able to at on the answer.

=== The Owner's Word Weights a Ton

There is no such thing as a casual suggestion when to comes from the owner. 
Inevitably becomes a top priority.

It takes great restraint as the leader of an org not to keep lobbing ideas at everyone else. 
Every such idea is a pebble thats going to cause ripples when it hits the surface.

=== Low Hanging Fruit Can Still Be Out of Reach

The further away you are form the fruit the lower it looks. 
Once you get up close you see its quite a bit higher than you thought. 
We assumed that picking it will be easy because we've never tried to do it before.

Declaring that an unfamiliar task will yield low hanging fruit is almost always an admission that you have little insight about what you're setting out to do.

The worst is when you load up these expectations on new hires and assume they'll meet them all quickly. 
You're basically setting them up to fail.

The idea that you'll instantly more needles because you've never tried to move them until now is delusional.

=== Don't Cheat Sleep

Continued sleep deprivation batters your IQ and saps your creativity

=== Out of Whack

Be responsible with your tie and make sure your team knowns when you wont be arond.

We ask reasonable people to make reasonable choices and the company will be reasonable back.

=== Hire the Work, Not the Resume

Whenever somone joins (or leaves) a team, the old team is gone. 
Its a new team now. 
No matter the group, every personnel change chagnes the dynamics.

At Basecamp they put a real project project in front of the candidate so they can show what they can do. 
Hire them for a week and ask them to do a sample project. 

No riddles, blackboard problems, or fake "come up with an answer on teh spot" scenarios. 
They give peopel real work to do and appropriate time to do it in. 
Its the same kind of work they would be doing if they got the job.

By focusing on the person and the work we can avoid hiring an imanginary person. 
Its easy to fall for somones well crafted story.

=== Nobody Hits the ground running

There is a matural assumption that someone who was already a specific role previously will be able to step right into that role anywhere and be effective immediately. 
It just aint so!! 
Organizations differ widely. 
The skills and experience needed to get traction in one place are often totally different somwhere else.

Time to take to get up to speed can be multiplied when you have senior people who switch from a role at a big company to a little company or vice versa.

=== Ignore The Talent War

Talent isn't worth fighting over. 
Talent should be thought of something that is grown and nurtured. 

It takes patience to grow and nurture your own talent. 
But the work it takes is the same work that improves the company for everyone.

=== Don't Negoiate Salaries

Everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same. 

Levels: junior, senior, lead, principal.

Every year they review market rates and issue raises. 
Target is to pay everyone at the top 10% of the market regardless of their role. 
If below the target you get a raise to match target. 
If already above they stay were they are at. 
If promoted they get a raise to match the market rate. 
Market rates are from a variety of salary surveying companies. 
Market rates based on San Francisco. 
Its the highest paying city in the world for their industry. 
They dont pay traditional bonuses so salaries are benchmarked against other companies salaries and bonus packages. 
No stock options instead they vowed to distribute 5% of all proceeds to all current employees if they sell the company. 
Profit growth sharing scheme - if total profit grow year over year they distribute 25% of that growth to all current employees in that year.

=== Benefits Who?

Often benefits are used as bribes to stay at the office longer and work more hours.

Basecamp looks at benefits to help people get away from work and lead healthier more interesting lives.

* Fully paid vacations every year for anyone who has been with the cmpany for more than a year. Up to $5000 per person or family.
* 3 day weekends all summar. May through September. Friday or Monday off.
* 30 day paid sabbatical every 3 years
* $1000 per year continuing education stipend. not about learning a skill people can use at work. its about everything outside of work.
* $2000 charity match
* A local monthly CSA (community supported agriculture) share.
* One monthly massage. not at the office
* $100 monthly fitnese allowance.

=== Library Rules

Open office plans suck at providing an environment for calm, creative work done by professionals who need peace, quiet, privacy and space to think and do their best.

Its even worse when you mix professions with difference requirements.

Library rules at the office
* If someone is at their desk we assume they're deep in thought and focused on their work. 
That means don't walk up to them and interrupt them.
* Conversations should be kept to a whisper.

To account for the need for the occasional full-volume collaboration they designed a handful of small rooms in the center of the office.

Skeptical? Make the first Thursday of the month Library Rules day at the office.

=== No Fakecations

Fakecations - where employees can still be reeled into conference calls, asked to "hop on a quick call" or expected to be available whenever a question comes up.

Fakecations put employees on a leash.

Unlimited vacation is a stressful benefit beause its not truely unlimited. 
Ambiguity breeds anxiety. 
People actually end up taking less time off. 
They err on the safe side.

Basecamp offers 3 weeks paid vacation, a fw extra personal days to use at your own discretion and standard national holidays every year. 
This is a guideline. 
If you need more days no problem. 
Days aren't tracked.

=== Calm Goodbyes

If you don't clearly communicate to everyone why someone was let go the people who remain will ome up with their own stories to explain it.

A dismissal opens a vacuum and unless you fill that vacuum with facts it'll quickly fill with rumos, conjecture, anxiety and fear. 
If you want to avoid that you simply have to be honest and clear with everyone about what happened.

Whenever someone leaves Basecamp an immediate goodbye accouncement is sent out company wide. 
The announcement is written by either the person leaving or their manager. 
It's their choice. 
Either way somone has to write one. 
The person leaving then gets to see all the resonses to the announcement from everyone else in the company. 

Note: If their message to the company doesn't include exact details on why they are leaving their manager will post a follow up mesage the following week filling in the gaps. 
When someone leaves for another job, the whole story is usually shared by the person who's leaving. 
But when someone is let go, we often have to clarify once they're gone. 
It's important that the reasons are clear and no questions linger unanswered.

== Dissect Your Process

=== The Wrong Time For Real Time

Following chat at work is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda. 

If you're not at your station when the conversation rolls by you'll never get a chance to put in your two cents. 
This means if you want to have your say you need to be paying attention all day. 

Chat is great for hashing stuff out quickly when speed is truely important such as an emergency/crisis. 

Almost everything can and should wait until someone has had a chance to think it through and property write it up.

When it comes to chat we have two primary rules of thumb: 
* "Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time" 
* "If it's important, slow down"

Important topics need time, traction, and separation from the rest of the chatter.

If something is being discussed in chat room and its clearly too important to process one line at a time, we ask peopele to "write it up" instead. 
This goes together with the rule "If everyone needs to see it, dont chat about it. 
Give the discussion a dedicated, permanent home.

Chat is great as a small slice but not the whole pie of communication.

=== Dreadlines

Dreadlines - unrealistic dates mired by ever expanding project requirements. 
More work piles on but the timeline remains the same.

Without a fixed, believable deadline you cant work calmly. 

Basecamp does fixed deadlines but what variable is the scope of hte problem - the work itself. 
But only on the downside. 
Projects can only get smaller over time.

As we progress, we separate the must haves from the nice to haves and toss out the non-essentials.

The team working on the work decides what stays and what goes in a fixed period of time. 
They have control over the work.

Another way to think about your deadlines is that they're based on budgets, not estimates. 
People suck at estimates but are quite good at setting and spending budgets.

Ex: if we tell a team that they have six weeks to build a great calendar feature they're much more likely to produce great work them if we asked them how long it'll take to build this specific calendar feature.

A deadline with flexible scope invites pushback, compromises and trade offs.

Its when you try to fix both scope and time that you have a recipe for dread, overwork, and exhaustion. 

=== Dont Be a knee-jerk

Most companies peope put together a deck, reserve a conference room, and call a meeting to pitch a new idea. 
When its over people react which is precisely the problem.

Flip the script.

Instead at Basecamp when we present work its almost always written up first. 
A complete idea in the form of a carefully composed multipage document. 
Illustrated whenever possible. 
Then posted to Basecamp which lets everyone involved know theres a complete idea waiting to be considered. Considered!

Basecamp prefers to present out of person, not in person.

Want people to take time to read (multiple times) absorb/reflect consider.

=== Watch Out For 12-day Weeks

Dont release on Friday. 
If there are urgent issues it wrecks the weekend for those that released the software.

Instead of shipping on Friday wait until Monday the following week. 
This introduces risk, releasing on perhaps the busiest day but knowing that helps better prepare for the release.

=== The New Normal

Unwinding the new normal requires far more effort than preventing that new normal from being set in the first place.

Culture is what culture does. 
Culture isn't what you intend it to be. 
Its not what you hope or aspire for it to be.

=== Bad Hanits Beat Good Intentions

What we do repeatedly hardens into havits. 
The longer you carry on the tougher it is to change. 
All your best intentions about doing the right thinkg "later" are no match for power of habits.

When calm starts early, calm becomes he habit. 

You have to keep asking yourself if the way you're working today is the way you'd want to work in 10, 20, 30 years. 
If not, now is the time to make a change, not "later".

Later is where excuses live. 
Later is where good intentions go to die.

=== Independencies

Things should fit together rather than stick together.

Dependencies are tangled, interwined teams, groups, or individuals that cant move independently of one another.

Throwing away a bunch of work simply because of the way you work on it, is a morale gut punch.

Dont tie knots, cut more ties. 
The fewer the bond the better.

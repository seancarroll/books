## Introduction: The System Lens

> Managers are not confronted with problems that are indepeend of each other, but with dynamic situgations that const of complex systems of chaning problems that interact with each other. 
> I call such situations messes... Managers do not solve problems, they anage messes.
>   --Russell Ackoff, operations theorist

Once we see the relationship between structure and behavior, we can begin to understand how systems work, what makes them produce poor results, and how to shift them into better behavior patterns.

As our world continues to change rapidly and become more complex, systems thinking will help us manage, adapt, and see the wide range of choices we have before us. 
It is this way of thinking that gives us the freedom to identify root causes of problems and see new opportunities.

A system is a set of things--people, cells, molecules, or whatever--interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern or behaviour over time.
The sytem may be buffeted, constricted, teriggered, or driver by outside forces. 
But the system's response to these forces is characteristic of itself, and that response is seldom simpile in the real world.

The syste, to a large extent, causes its own behavior! 
An outside event may unleash that behavior, but the same outside event applied to a different system is likely to produce a different result.

Modern systems theory, bound up with computers and equations, hides the fact that it traffics in truths known at some level by everyone. 
It is often possible, therefore, to make a direct translation from systems jargon to traditional wisdom.

Intrinsically systems problems - undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them.

Systems Zoo - a collection of some common and interesting types of a system.

Systems thinkers call these common structures that produce characteristic behaviors "archetypes."

Systems thinking lens allows us to 
* hone our abilities to understand parts
* see interconnections
* ask "what-if" questions about possible future behaviors
* be creative and courageous about system redesign

The ancient Sufi story "The Blind Men and the Matter of the Elephant" was told to teach a simple lesson but one that we often ignore: The behavior of a system cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made.

## Part One: System Structure and Behavior

### ONE. The Basics

> I have yet to see any problems, however complicated, which, when looked at in teh right way, did not become still more complicated.
>  - Poul Anderson

A *system* is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. 

system must consist of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections, and function or purpose.

Is there anything that is not a system? Yes--a conglomeration without any particular interconnections or function.

Systems can change, adapt, respond to events, seek goals, med injuries, and attend to their own survival in lifelike ways, although they may contain or consis of nonliving things. 
Systems can be self-organizing, and often are self-repairing over at least some range of disruptions. 
They are resilient, and many of them are evolutionary. 
Out of one system other completely new, never before imagined system can arise.

A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.

The elements of a system are often the easiest parts to notice, becuase many of them are visible, tangible things.

Elements do not have to be physical things. 
Intangibles are also elements of a system.

It's a good idea to stop dissecting out elements and to start looking for the interconnections, the relationships that hold the elemetns together.

How to know whether you are looking at a system or just a munch of stuff:
A) Can you identify parts?
B) Do the parts affect each other?
C) Do the parts together produce an effecct that is different from the effect of each part on its own.
D) Does the effect, the behavior over time, persist in a variety of circumstance.
